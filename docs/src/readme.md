# Introduction

**Brainease** is a scripting language that has many similar concepts with
[brainf\*ck](http://brainfuck.org/), sharing some principal concepts, like
[memory](memory.md) and [instructions](instructions/index.md). It was created to be a
simple and faster language to create, but also to be a language that is easy to read and
understand.

- One instruction per line, long files but shorter width.
- Syntax highlighting for every IDE that supports
  [highlighting for the `R` language](./learning/ide.md).
- Memory management done with a simple, fast and linear memory allocation system.
- Python-like indentation system - Just **two** spaces.
