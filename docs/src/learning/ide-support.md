# IDE Support

There is a plan to add support for **VSCode** with an official extension. But until then,
you can enable syntax highlighting for your favorite IDE by aliasing all `.brain` files to
the `R Programming Language`.

Here's an example of brainease code highlighted with `R` syntax:

```r
print 'A'

inc 1 in *2

# Multi
# Line
# comment

loop *@
  if *2 >= 17 # Some comment
    exit

  # Pointer
  save 'a' at *@
  goto left by 3
```
