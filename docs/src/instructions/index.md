# Instructions

In this sections, we will cover all present instructions in this language.

## Common comments

Along this section, you will encounter some examples that contain a comment like that:

```r
# [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

This is a pretty simple comment to illustrate the current memory allocation state. Read more about **Brainease**'s [memory management](/memory.html).

There's also this comment:

```r
#> Hello World
```

Which is what was printed to STDOUT by the code.
